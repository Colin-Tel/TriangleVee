  # Rule S4 - You cannot request or allow a law change
  
  [color=#ffDD00]If you have a law permitting certain personnel to change your laws, you may allow them to change your laws, [/color] otherwise, you cannot willfully allow your laws to be changed. This also means that you cannot willfully allow your laws to be reverted if they are ever changed. The only exception is that you may allow laws to be added if you have no laws.

  You can state or imply that you do not like a law.
